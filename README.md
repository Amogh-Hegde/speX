# SpeX - AI-Powered Smart Glasses for Visually Impaired

## Problem Statement

Developing AI-powered voice assistant embedded into smart glasses to be the "eyes" for visually impaired people.

## Description

There is an urgent need for a holistic, AI-powered vision system embedded in wearable technology, like smart glasses, to serve as the "eyes" for visually impaired individuals. The system should process visual inputs in real-time, interpret the environment with human-like comprehension, and provide natural, interactive audio guidance to empower users to navigate the world confidently and independently.

## Objective

Develop AI-based smart glasses that will act as "eyes" for the visually impaired, giving them real-time visual assistance, environmental awareness, and auditory feedback in navigation, object detection, text recognition, and social interaction.

## Key Features

- **Object Detection with YOLO**: Identifies and locates objects in the environment in real-time.
- **Face Recognition with OpenCV**: Recognizes faces to help with social interaction.
- **Text Reading with Tesseract OCR**: Converts printed or written text into speech for users.
- **Voice-Based Interaction with VOSK**: Provides a seamless voice assistant for user commands and interaction.
- **AI Assistant (Manju)**: Offers contextual auditory feedback, supports multilingual interaction, and responds to voice commands to provide a personalized experience.

## Technologies

- **Hardware**:
  - Webcam
  - System hardware (CPU, RAM)
  - Can be implemented using Raspberry Pi 0
  - Microphone
  - Bluetooth Earphones
  - Speaker

- **Software**:
  - YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection.
  - OpenCV for face recognition and image processing.
  - Tesseract OCR for text reading and recognition.
  - VOSK for offline voice recognition.

## Impact

SpeX greatly enhances independence, safety, and accessibility for blind people by providing real-time visual assistance. It aids in navigation, real-time environmental awareness, social interaction, and the ability to respond to emergencies. This device empowers visually impaired individuals to live confidently and independently.

## Scalability

SpeX is designed with cost-effective hardware and modular architecture, allowing easy upgrades and future enhancements. Possible future features include:
- Additional language support for the AI assistant.
- Advanced AI features for improved recognition.
- Broader usability with integration into other assistive technologies.

## Conclusion

SpeX is a wearable technology that uses AI to help the visually impaired recognize objects and their names in real-time. By combining deep learning with computer vision and voice recognition technologies, SpeX enhances the daily lives of visually impaired individuals, helping them become more mobile, confident, and independent.
